"Architecture, Compilers, and Parallel Computing","Our research groups explore energy efficiency via low-voltage design techniques, specialized hardware accelerators, adaptive runtime techniques in high performance computing, efficient memory architectures for heterogeneous mobile systems, novel architectures for exascale systems, and other projects. We examine resilience through tolerating variation during chip fabrication, failure-tolerant processor architectures, scalable resilience protocols, and automated software debugging and recovery techniques. We explore programmability through architectural support for synchronization, automatic parallelization and vectorization, performance-portability for heterogeneous mobile systems, high-performance implementations of scripting languages, and highly scalable parallel run-time systems.","low voltage design techniques, hardware accelerators, adaptive runtime techniques in high performance computing, efficient memory architectures"
Artificial Intelligence,"The study of systems that behave intelligently, artificial intelligence includes several key areas where our faculty are recognized leaders: computer vision, machine listening, natural language processing, and machine learning. Computer vision systems can understand images and video, for example, building extensive geometric and physical models of cities from video, or warning construction workers about nearby dangers. Natural language processing systems understand written and spoken language; possibilities include automatic translation of text from one language to another, or understanding text on Wikipedia to produce knowledge about the world. Machine listening systems understand audio signals, with applications like listening for crashes at traffic lights, or transcribing polyphonic music automatically. Crucial to modern artificial intelligence, machine learning methods exploit examples in order to adjust systems to work as effectively as possible.","computer vision, machine listening, natural language processing, machine learning"
Bioinformatics and Computational Biology,"Our researchers work on core computational biology-related problems, including genomics, proteomics, metagenomics, and phylogenomics. We develop novel techniques that combine ideas from mathematics, computer science, probability, statistics, and physics, and we help identify and formalize computational challenges in the biological domain, while experimentally validating novel hypotheses generated by our analyses. We are developing algorithms with improved accuracy for large-scale and complex estimation problems in phylogenomics (genome-scale phylogeny estimation), multiple sequence alignment, and metagenomics. We are exploring gene regulation—developing advanced techniques to predict the diverse function of noncoding parts of DNA and to relate interspecies and interpersonal differences in DNA to differences in the organism’s form and function. We work broadly in the development of machine learning techniques for computational biology, with research spanning the areas of molecular and structural biology; networks and systems biology; and molecular mechanisms of human disease.","genomics, proteomics, metagenomics, phylogenomics, molecular and structural biology, networks and systems biology, molecular mechanisms of human disease"
